\section{The Universe}
This is an exploratory program for simulating the universe.
The goal is to come up with a simple simulation of a 2D universe that has traits very similar to our universe.

\section{The Particles}
The particles are very similar to our universe, there are currently two particles : matter and force.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item
	Matter particles are the objects of the universe, they emit force particles from time to time.
\item
	Force particles change the potential of matter particles, changes in potential create acceleration.
\end{enumerate}
